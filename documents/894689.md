Two techniques are available for TPD: the PiCCO (Pulse index Continuous Cardiac Output) system and the EV1000.

## Indications

PiCCO is a suitable diagnostic for those with evolving critical illness or at high risk of complex and severe haemodynamic derangement. It requires intra-arterial and central venous catheterisation.

<div class="alert alert--warning" role="alert">
Several PiCCO measurements require further validation within the context of their intended clinical use.

## PiCCO parameters

### Cardiac index (CI) & stroke volume index (SVI)

Cardiac index is the amount of blood pumped by the heart per minute indexed to 1 m2 of the body surface area (BSA); the cardiac index represents the global blood flow.


:::tip
<b>cardiac index (CI)</b>

2.5–5 L/min/m<sup>2</sup>
:::

stroke volume index (SVI)

40–60 ml/m2

### Global end-diastolic volume index (GEDI)

Surrogate parameter of preload.

global end-diastolic volume index (GEDI)

680–800 ml/m2

### Stroke volume variation (SVV) & pulse pressure variation (PPV)

The higher the variation the more likely the patient is to be volume responsive. Can only be applied with a patient that is continuously ventilated and has a stable heart rhythm.

PPV = PP max − PP min PP mean PPV = { PP_max - PP_min } over { PP_mean }
Stroke volume variation

SVV = SV max − SV min SV mean SVV = { SV_max - SV_min } over { SV_mean }
SVV & PPV

< 10 %

### Systemic vascular resistance index (SVRI)

Surrogate parameter of afterload.
be careful

If the afterload exceeds the performance of the myocardium, the heart may decompensate.
systemic vascular resistance index (SVRI)

SVRI = [ ( MAP − CVP ) CI ] x 80 SVRI = left [ { (MAP - CVP) } over { CI } right ] x 80
systemic vascular resistance index (SVRI)

1,700–2,400 dyn*s*cm-5

### Global ejection fraction (GEF)

Ejection fraction represents the percentage of volume in a heart chamber which is ejected with a single contraction. The measurement of the global ejection fraction offers a complete picture of the overall cardiac contractility.

global ejection fraction (GEF)

GEF = 4 x SV GEDV GEF = { 4 x SV } over { GEDV }
global ejection fraction (GEF)

25–35 %

### Cardiac function index (CFI)

The cardiac function index can be used to estimate cardiac contractility. It represents the relation of the flow (cardiac output) and the preload volume (GEDV). Thus, cardiac function index is a preload related cardiac performance parameter.

cardiac function index (CFI)

CFI = CI TD x 1,000 GEDV CFI = { CI_TD x 1,000 } over { GEDV }
cardiac function index (CFI)

4.5–6.5 L/min

### Cardiac power index (CPI)

CPI represents the power of left ventricular cardiac output in watts. It is the product of pressure (MAP) and flow (CO). In clinical studies it has been found to be the strongest independent predictor of hospital mortality in cardiogenic shock patients.

cardiac power index (CPI)

CPI = CIPC x MAP x 0.0022 CPI = CIPC x MAP x 0.0022
cardiac power index (CPI)

0.5–0.7 W/m2

### Left ventricular contractility (dPmx)

From the arterial pressure curve, the pressure changes during the systolic phase can be analysed and a measure of the pressure increase over time (analysed in speed) is calculated. The steeper the upslope of the curve, the higher the contractility of the left ventricle. As the upslope also depends on the individual compliance of the aorta, the parameter should primarily be viewed and evaluated as part of the overall trend.

### Extravascular lung water index (ELWI)

Extravascular lung water is indexed to the body weight in kg, written as the extravascular lung water index (ELWI). By indexing to the patient’s predicted body weight (PBW), underestimation of lung water, particularly in obese patients, is avoided.

extravascular lung water index (ELWI)

3–7 ml/kg

### Pulmonary vascular permeability index (PVPI)

A differential diagnosis of the pulmonary edema is important because the therapeutic approach is quite different. In cardiogenic pulmonary edema, a negative fluid balance is sought, while in cases of permeability pulmonary edema treating the cause of inflammation has priority. The pulmonary vascular permeability index (PVPI) enables this differential diagnosis. This parameter is calculated from the relation between extravascular lung water (EVLW) and pulmonary blood volume (PBV).

pulmonary vascular permeability index (PVPI)

< 3 or >= 3 cardiogenic edema or permeability edema respectively
