## Definition of shock
Circulatory shock is a life-threatening, generalized form of acute circulatory failure associated with inadequate oxygen utilization by the cells.

## Targets of therapy
### Blood pressure
- individualize the target blood pressure during shock resuscitation
- initially target a MAP of ≥65 mmHg
- tolerate a lower level of blood pressure in patients with uncontrolled bleeding (i.e. in patients with trauma) without severe head injury
- target a higher MAP in septic patients with history of hypertension and in patients that show clinical improvement with higher blood pressure

## Fluid resuscitation
- use dynamic (instead of static) variables to predict fluid responsiveness
- perform fluid challenges, unless in cases of obvious hypovolemia (such as overt bleeding in a ruptured aneurysm)
- fluid management should be titrated carefully, especially in the presence of elevated intravascular filling pressures or extravascular lung water

## Monitoring
– perform further hemodynamic assessment (such as assessing cardiac function) to determine the type of shock if the clinical examination does not lead to a clear diagnosis
– echocardiography is the preferred modality to initially evaluate the type of shock as opposed to more invasive technologies
- in complex patients, additionally use pulmonary artery catheterization or transpulmonary thermodilution to determine the type of shock
- do not perform routine measurement of cardiac output for patients with shock responding to the initial therapy
- do perform measurements of cardiac output and stroke volume to evaluate the response to fluids or inotropes in patients that are not responding to initial therapy
- perform sequential evaluation of hemodynamic status during shock
- echocardiography can be used for the sequential evaluation of cardiac function in shock
- do not routinely perform pulmonary artery catheterization for patients in shock 
- perform pulmonary artery catheterization in patients with refractory shock and right ventricular dysfunction
- use of transpulmonary thermodilution or pulmonary artery catheterization in patients with severe shock especially in the case of associated acute respiratory distress syndrome
- use less invasive devices, instead of more invasive devices, only when they have been validated in the context of patients with shock
